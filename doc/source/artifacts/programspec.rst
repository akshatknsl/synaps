Program Specification
=====================

Synaps is a cloud monitoring system that collects metric data, provides 
statistics data, monitors and notifies based on user defined alarms.

It supports users to collect and monitor their default metrics (eg. 
CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, DiskWriteOps, DiskReadBytes, DiskWriteBytes,
NetworkReadBytes and NetworkWriteBytes) and their own custom metrics also. 

It is used to monitor tenant's applications and services on the OpenStack are 
working well. If CPUUtiliztion of an instance running their service is greater 
than the threshold they have been set, they can be notified.

Synaps is linear scalable so that it might be suitable for deploying on the 
virtual machines as a SaaS(software as a service).

Program Architecture
--------------------

Synaps API is frontend of the system. It uses RabbitMQ for asynchronous 
processing requested messages. And the messages are passed to Synaps Strom.

Synaps Storm is a topology implementation which is aimed to run on the Twitter
Storm, real-time distributed stream processing system. Synaps Storm is based on 
the message driven architecture. Most of the messages are came from RabbitMQ.
It notifies using Notification Queue. Any other notification system can  
interoperate with the queue.

Both Synaps API and Storm programs are use Cassandra no-sql database to store 
persistent data.   

Following is Architecture of Synaps.

Following is an example of an integrated system.

Externally, Synaps interoperates with agents which inputs metric data 
periodically, such as VMMON which can get information from VM Hyperisor with 
libvirt library and Nova API, and custom agent also.

Synaps Notification is a program to send E-mail or SMS.

Program: Synaps API
-------------------

Synaps API is WSGI based Web Server which provides AWS CloudWatch compatible 
API.

Asynchrous request processing

Program: Synaps Storm

Synaps Storm is a topology implementation which is aimed to run on the Twitter

PutMetricData message processing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This function is the most important part of Synaps. When the PutMetricData 
message is received via RabbitMQ message queue, it reads its in-memory sliding 
windows or database to aggregate its datapoints and evalutate status of 
its alarms. If the status is changed, it sends action message to notification 
queue.

PutMetricAlarm message processing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the PutMetricAlarm message is received via RabbitMQ message queue, it
find its metric and update its in-memory alarm data and update it into 
database.

PeriodicMonitoring message processing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

'check_spout' generates PeriodicMonitoring message every 1 minute. When this is
generated, it checks their whole alarms if they are not evaluated alarms 
recently PutMetricData message processing.
